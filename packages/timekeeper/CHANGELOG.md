Configurable setting to auto enable time tracking on all projects on load (defaults to false/disabled, enable it in the package settings to activate it)

### v0.3.0

Mostly UI related changes in the release, listed below:

- Cosmetic updates to the status bar clock and status messages

- Preliminary & basic version of the Dashboard UI with count of projects being tracked with timekeeper & recent projects list available now (not very useful still, but it is a start)

### v0.2.0

Added tracking of focus out periods, to allow for more comprehensive data collection and subsequently better reporting.

### v0.1.0

First release as a separate package after split from [Protons](https://atom.io/packages/protons) which will be deprecated soon in favor of individual packages.
